1. How It works
    a) First, We get the Location of the inputed address. we do this by using a request to a website(mapquest.com) and it gives
    an JSON file.
    b) Secondly, We use API of the Forecast.io to get the weather.
    b) Thirdly, We create an API(appication program interface) and through this we help the two websites communicate to each
    other.
